 * runtime implementation is used, and to simplify transparent testing of individual components by registering mocks
 * for other components on which the tested component depends, which will then be automatically used by all code that
 * accesses those components through this macro or the underlying SBBComponentManager component: class method.
 *
 *  @param componentClass The class for which to retrieve the registered component instance.
